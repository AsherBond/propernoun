    # pdns table ``domains`` must have this entry
    domain: example.com

    # example, "prefix: vm-" or "suffix: .vm" would clearly label
    # every entry as virtual machines
    prefix:
    suffix: .vm

    # Any ip addresses in these networks (matching prefix and suffix)
    # that are not seen in the current leases database will be deleted

    # entries. You have been warned.
